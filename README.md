# Toy CSharp

## Introduction

This is sample code to get started with C# and C# unit tests.

## Usage

- Clone this repo in VS Code.
- Install all suggested extensions.
- Open the files `toy/JustSomeCode.cs` and `toy/JustSomeCode.Tests.cs` side by side.
- Build the solution using `Terminal`, `Run Build Task`, `dotnet: build`.
- Click on the Testing panel icon panel on the left (notice how the tooltip says "Testing"). `Run Tests`.
- Fix the code in `JustSomeCode.cs` so that tests pass :-)
