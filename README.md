This is sample code to get started with C# and C# unit tests.

## Usage

- Install all suggested extensions.
- Open the files `toy/JustSomeCode.cs` and `toy/JustSomeCode.Tests.cs` side by side.
- Click on the Testing panel icon panel on the left (notice how the tooltip says "Testing"). Run all tests.
- Fix the code in JustSomeCode.cs so that tests pass :-)
