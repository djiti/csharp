# Toy CSharp

## Introduction

This is sample code to get started with C# and C# unit tests.

The goal is for developers to fix the methods (wherever there is a `TODO`) until all tests pass.

## Usage

### (Easier) In GitHub CodeSpaces

- Log on to your GitHub account
- Go to `<> Code`, add a Codespace
- Log on to your Microsoft identity as suggested
- Open the files `toy/JustSomeCode.cs` and `toy/JustSomeCode.Tests.cs` side by side
- Restore the dotnet project using the icon with three hozirontal lines, then `Terminal`, `Run Build Task`, `dotnet: build`.
- Click on the Testing panel icon panel on the left (notice how the tooltip says "Testing"). `Run Tests`
- Fix the code in `JustSomeCode.cs` so that tests pass :-)

### In VS Code

- Clone this repo in VS Code: View, Command Palette, type `Git: Clone` then provide the URL
- Install all suggested extensions or use devcontainer
- Log on to your Microsoft identity as suggested
- Open the files `toy/JustSomeCode.cs` and `toy/JustSomeCode.Tests.cs` side by side
- Restore the dotnet project using the top menu `Terminal`, `Run Build Task`, `dotnet: build`.
- Click on the Testing panel icon panel on the left (notice how the tooltip says "Testing"). `Run Tests`
- Fix the code in `JustSomeCode.cs` so that tests pass :-)
